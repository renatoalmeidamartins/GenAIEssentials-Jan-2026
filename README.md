## Access to labs and course materials
- [Access to labs and course materials](https://us-east-1.student.classrooms.aws.training/class/kKZbRgqUwExp7P8F5UKLor) . When you open this link, you will be prompted to signin. The preferred way is using "builder id". Problem is this tipically only works with personal emails. I have added your corporate accounts (long and short emails). To use it, choose One-time email password (preferred) or SSO. The SSO option eventually prevents us from working properly on the labs. Once registered, **if you get an access denied, saying "you don't have the class. please contaxt xyz for assistance"** error, share with me the email used through the chat, so I can add it to the class.
